  <br>BrainBytes is an educational chatbot to help students understand complex concepts and definitions through short, memorable stories
</p>

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to develop a domain-specific application that combines the strengths of a Large Language Model (LLM) for understanding and processing natural language queries with the efficiency of a vector database for data storage and retrieval. This application focuses on creating a responsive chatbot for the educational domain, providing personalized recommendations using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain and LLMs.

## Key Features

- **File Upload:** Ability to upload a pdf or word document for the RAG Application
- **Quiz Generation:** To solidify and test your learning, you can generate some quiz questions
- **Image Generation:** Generate images using DALLE based on defination and story to help remember information visually
- **Story-lenth Adjuster** Option to adjust a scroller to manage the length of the story
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to input their preferences and needs through a conversational interface.
- **RAG-Based Recommendations:** Generates recommendations based on user inputs using RAG.
- **Intelligent Responses:** Provides relevant information and suggestions, ensuring recommendations are accurate to the user's context and preferences.
- **Pre-existing Data:** Recommendations are created only from the existing data in the vector store.
- **Backend Integration:** Utilizes LangChain to manage the flow of interactions, with data stored in a vector database.
- **Data Fetching:** Fetches the top K (K <= 3) data entries based on the user's description using similarity search.
## About the App

BrainBytes is built using the following technologies:
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive user interface
- **LangChain**: For managing conversational flows and prompts
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo model/ Fine tuned GPT4o-mini model for natural language processing and response generation

## Domain Selection

**Domain:** Education

**User Base:** Students

## Purpose

- Help students understand and remember complex academic concepts.
- Provide simple stories and definitions to aid memory retention.

## Scope and Queries

- The chatbot will handle queries related to academic concepts across various subjects such as Sciences, Tech, History, Arts, and more.
- It will provide concise definitions followed by simple stories to explain the concepts.

## Prompt Patterns Used

**Persona Pattern:**
- The AI is defined as an "educational assistant" to ensure consistent, role-specific responses.

**Template Pattern:**
- The AI follows a structured format: first providing a short definition, then generating a simple story to explain the concept clearly and memorably.

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit

## What's Next

### 1. Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Objective:**
Enhance BrainBytes's ability to provide detailed and contextually rich educational content by integrating a retrieval system that fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating responses.

**Example: Biology - Photosynthesis**
- **User Query:** "Can you explain photosynthesis?"
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes retrieves detailed descriptions and diagrams from textbooks and research articles.
- **Improved Story:** "Imagine a city powered by the Sun, where special factories called chloroplasts convert sunlight into food for the city, with chlorophyll acting as diligent workers capturing sunlight."

### 2. Multi-Language Support

**Objective:**
Expand BrainBytes's accessibility by supporting multiple languages, allowing students from different linguistic backgrounds to benefit.

**Example: History - World War II**
- **User Query:** "Â¿Puedes explicar las causas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial?"
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes detects the query language and retrieves relevant documents in Spanish.
- **Improved Story:** "Imagina un aula donde el Tratado de Versalles es un profesor estricto que impone sanciones severas, causando resentimiento y dando lugar a la Segunda Guerra Mundial."

### 3. Personalized Learning Paths

**Objective:**
Provide personalized learning experiences based on the user's history and preferences.

**Example: Mathematics - Calculus**
- **User Query:** "How do you differentiate a function?"
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes retrieves the user's previous interactions and preferences, offering tailored explanations and practice problems.
- **Improved Story:** "Think of differentiation as peeling an onion layer by layer to understand its core. Each layer represents a small change in the function's behavior."

### 4. Interactive Learning Modules

**Objective:**
Make learning more engaging with interactive elements such as quizzes and simulations.

**Example: Chemistry - Chemical Reactions**
- **User Query:** "What are the types of chemical reactions?"
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes retrieves detailed examples and interactive simulations of different chemical reactions.
- **Improved Story:** "Imagine a cooking class where ingredients (reactants) are mixed to create delicious dishes (products). Each recipe (reaction type) has unique steps and outcomes."

### 5. Enhanced User Interface

**Objective:**
Improve the overall user experience with a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.

**Example: Physics - Newton's Laws**
- **User Query:** "Explain Newton's First Law."
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes retrieves detailed diagrams and real-world examples to complement the explanation.
- **Improved Story:** "Picture a soccer ball at rest. According to Newton's First Law, it will stay at rest until a player kicks it, demonstrating the principle of inertia."

### 6. Community and Collaboration Features

**Objective:**
Foster a learning community for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

**Example: Literature - Shakespearean Plays**
- **User Query:** "What is the significance of Hamlet's soliloquy?"
- **RAG Enhancement:** BrainBytes retrieves analyses and interpretations from various sources, and integrates community discussion features.
- **Improved Story:** "Imagine Hamlet as a modern-day student reflecting on life's challenges in a school play. His soliloquy captures his internal struggles, much like students debating life's big questions in a discussion forum."
